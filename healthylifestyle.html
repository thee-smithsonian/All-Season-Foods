    <p>To burn fat, your body must first break it down in the fat cell and move it into your bloodstream. Studies suggest that the active 
        compounds in green tea can aid this procees by boosting the effects of some fat-burning hormones, such as norepinephrine
        (noradrenaline). The main antioxidant in tea, EGCG, can help inhibit an enzyme that breaks down the hormone norepinephrine.
    </p>
    <p>When the enzyme is inhibited, the amount of neropinephrine increases, promoting fat breakdown. In fact, caffeine and EGCG - 
        may have a synergistic effect. Ultimately, your fat celll breaks down more fat, which is released into your bloodstream for use a energy
        by cells like muscle cells.

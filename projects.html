    Casablanca Caf&eacute; opened in August 2003 with the idea to provide a stylish caf&eacute; that 
    focuses quite simply on excellent coffee, authentic Asian sweets, great food and 
    hospitable service. Since opening our speciality of Asian sweets and famous sandwiches
    in East London has been regarded by local people, public and other industry as one of
    leading caf&eacute;s of its kind in the U.K, setting an example and benchmark for all other 
    Caf&eacute;s to follow.

    Casablanca Caf&eacute; opened in August 2003 with the idea to provide a stylish caf&eacute; that 
    focuses quite simply on excellent coffee, authentic Asian sweets, great food and 
    hospitable service. Since opening our speciality of Asian sweets and famous sandwiches
    in East London has been regarded by local people, public and other industry as one of
    leading caf&eacute;s of its kind in the U.K, setting an example and benchmark for all other 
    Caf&eacute;s to follow.

    For over 10 years we've provided top notch food to Londoners and to Home Counties, be it a 
    sumptuous three course meal for three hundred, a glittering canap&eacute; reception for five
    hundred or an important working lunch for twenty. We mix modern and traditional styles to cook
    up menus for every occassion. Most importantly, we keep it simple: our food is locally sourced, 
    freshly prepared and always delicious.
